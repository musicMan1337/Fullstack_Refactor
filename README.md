# Refactor of Full-Stack Web App

This was a Capstone project for Thinkful where we took an existing app (mock-client/server) and added some features/user stories. What's special about this version is that I went the extra mile to refactor the React client to use all functional components/hooks AND Typescript. I also cleaned up the server a bit, though not by too much.
